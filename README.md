<p>Penta is a language projected for musicians. Its syntax reminds the staff they draw notes on, with similar constructs and operators for notes's duration, beat time and more. 
<br><br>
The language is based on an EBNF grammar and generated by JTB tool. The project also contains a prototipal IDE, made of interpeters and compilers for Penta language. It can play music, create a MIDI file with it, draw notes on staff and print them on paper. Staff compiling is based on LASSUS font (http://www.dafont.com/lassus.font), which is incomplete and misses some symbols (semiquaver duration and below).</p>
